Meshes generated from ForestClaw

Each mesh directory contains

	-- mesh files
		* mesh.h0001 contains number of patches
		* mesh.m0001 contains patch connectivity information : 
		  Column 1     : patch ID  (0 through num_patches-1)
		  Column 2     : level (0 through maxlevel)
	  	  Column 3,4   : Face 0  (left face)
		  Column 5,6   : Face 1  (right face)
		  Column 7,8   : Face 2  (bottom face)
	      Column 9,10  : Face 3  (top face)

	      where face double (p1,p2) is the 1 or 2 patches at that face.  -1 is a physical boundary, and duplicated values are either same size or double size neighbors.  Distinct values correspond to two half size neighbors.

    -- fort.t0001 and fort.q0001 files : Used to plot output. 
        * fort.t0001 - head file for data
              Row 1 : Time (can probably be ignored)
              Row 2 : meqn - number of equations (probably 1)
              Row 3 : Number of patches
              Row 4,5 : (ignore)
              
        * fort.q0001 - contains patch data.   Each patch has a header section and data.

    -- Matlab plotting routines.  To plot, use command : 

           >> plotclaw2

       at the Matlab prompt.  You will have to skip the t=0 plot.   To get help on graphics, use the help command : 

           >> help clawgraphics
