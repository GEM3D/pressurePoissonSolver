README
--------------------
HWSCRT.F  solves \nabla^2 u + lambda*u = f, subject to dirichlet or neumann
boundary conditions.  See documentation included in hwscrt.f for details
This routine comes from the fishpack library, which is available at

    https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/legacy/fishpack

Fishpack also includes numerous others types of fast poisson solvers, including
separable variable coefficient solvers, 3d solvers, and solvers for staggered,
polar and cylindrical grids.


This test program tests only the poisson solver (i.e. lambda = 0).  To compile this,
use 'gmake all'.

To run the program, type 'test_hwscrt'.
Enter the problem choice, and problem size.  If you enter M=100, the code will compare
the error in your computed solution against the benchmark error, and report whether
your code appears to be  producing the correct results or not.
